The chronic hyperglycemia\nof diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of\ndifferent organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.\nSeveral pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These\nrange from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic b-cells with consequent\ninsulin deﬁciency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The\nbasis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes\nis deﬁcient action of insulin on target tissues. Deﬁcient insulin action results from\ninadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or\nmorepointsinthecomplexpathwaysofhormoneaction.Impairmentofinsulinsecretion",

Impairment of growth and\nsusceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia.\nAcute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia\nwith ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.\nLong-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of\nvision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot\nulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing\ngastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual\ndysfunction.

Individuals at increased risk of\ndeveloping this type of diabetes can often be identiﬁed by serological evidence of an\nautoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic\nmarkers.

What is diabetes? \n Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism where blood glucose (blood sugar) remains \ntoo high due to insufficient insulin production or inadequate action of available \ninsulin. \n2. What are the types of diabetes? \n \nBasically, diabetes mellitus can be of two types, based on how they are \ntreated/managed. One that definitively requires insulin from the very beginning \nfor treatment (often called type 1 DM). The other types are those that do not \nordinarily require insulin for treatment*. These types of diabetes are a \nheterogenous group with type 2 DM forming the major numbers (more than 90 \nper cent). \n (* All diabetics may require insulin for treatment in special situations). \n \n There are two other conditions: \na) Pre-diabetes is a condition when a person’s blood glucose levels are higher \nthan normal but not high enough to be called Type 2 DM. These blood sugar \nof such patients may go into the diabetic range during periods of stress.",

Accurate quantification of the risk for developing T1DM in a given \nindividual is necessary to be successful in prevention strategies. Currently, prediction strategies involve measurement of \nautoantibodies namely, ICA, IAA, GAD65, IA-2A/ICA51239 and genotyping for at risk HLA haplotypes (e.g., DR3-\nDQ2/DR4-DQ8).

An oral glucose tolerance \ntest (OGTT) is commonly used as the screening test10. \nFasting and 2 h post glucose tests can identify impaired \nfasting glucose (IFG) (fasting glucose >110 - <125 \nmg/dl), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2 h glucose \n>140-<200 mg/dl) and presence of diabetes (fasting > \n126 and 2 h glucose >200 mg/dl). If a random blood \nglucose value is > 150 mg/dl, further confirmation \nby an OGTT is warranted. Recently, glycosylated \nhaemoglobin (HbA1c) has been recommended as the \ntest for diagnosis of diabetes (>6.5%). Presence of pre-\ndiabetes is indicated by HbA1c values between 5.7 - 6.4 \nper cent11.\n\t\nScreening for undiagnosed T2DM is recommended \nat the first prenatal visit in women with above risk",
